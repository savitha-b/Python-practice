- Class variables: can be used to define variables that can be shared by different instances of a class. 
so this can be definedd in the class definition itself.

- Pre-defined Class Variables: Python has few.
eg: __doc__
trying it in python shell window,
>>> import turtle
>>> turtle.Turtle.__doc__
'RawTurtle auto-creating (scrolled) canvas.\n\n    When a Turtle object is created or a function derived from some\n    Turtle method is called a TurtleScreen object is automatically created.\n 

- Now try to use the same for class Movie.
put required documentation in triple quotes ni class definition.
